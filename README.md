# Crack_SDE_110

**Crack_SDE_110** is a **110-day structured challenge** designed to master core **Software Development Engineer (SDE)** fundamentals through disciplined daily practice.

Each day focuses on a balanced mix of:
- **C Programming** – deep fundamentals, memory, pointers, and problem-solving
- **Aptitude** – quantitative, logical, and analytical reasoning
- **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**
- **Low-Level Design (LLD)** concepts

This repository documents consistent daily practice across:
- **1000+ C programming problems**
- **1000+ aptitude questions**
- **300+ DSA problems**
- Core **LLD principles and design patterns**

## Daily Progress

- [Day 001](DAY_001.md)
- [Day 002](DAY_002.md)
- [Day 003](DAY_003.md)

## Purpose

The challenge is structured to build strong SDE foundations:
- **C** sharpens understanding of memory, execution, and low-level behavior
- **Aptitude** improves speed, accuracy, and logical clarity
- **DSA** strengthens algorithmic and problem-solving skills
- **LLD** bridges fundamentals with real-world system thinking

This is a long-term, consistency-driven preparation model focused on depth, clarity, and interview readiness.

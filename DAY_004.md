## APTITUDE (10)

1. Find the greatest number that will divide 43, 91, and 183 so as to leave the same remainder in each case.
2. Which of the following fractions is the largest?
   $\frac{7}{8}, \frac{13}{16}, \frac{31}{40}, \frac{63}{80}$
3. Solve for $x$: $\frac{0.009}{x} = 0.01$
4. Find the least perfect square which is divisible by each of 21, 36, and 66.
5. If $x = \frac{\sqrt{3}+1}{\sqrt{3}-1}$ and $y = \frac{\sqrt{3}-1}{\sqrt{3}+1}$, find the value of $(x^2 + y^2)$.
6. **Data Sufficiency:** What is Arun's present age?
    * **I.** Five years ago, Arun's age was double that of his son's age at that time.
    * **II.** Present ages of Arun and his son are in the ratio of 11:6 respectively.
    * **III.** Five years hence, the respective ratio of Arun's age and his son's age will become 12:7.
7. If 20% of $a$ = $b$, then $b$% of 20 is the same as how much percent of $a$?
8. If $A = x\%$ of $y$ and $B = y\%$ of $x$, which of the following is true?
    * A is smaller than B.
    * A is greater than B.
    * Relationship cannot be determined.
    * None of these (A equals B).
9. 3 pumps, working 8 hours a day, can empty a tank in 2 days. How many hours a day must 4 pumps work to empty the tank in 1 day?
10. One pipe can fill a tank three times as fast as another pipe. If together the two pipes can fill the tank in 36 minutes, then the slower pipe alone will be able to fill the tank in how much time?

## C PROGRAMMING SNIPPETS (10)

1.
```c
int x = 10, y = 100%90, i;
for(i=1; i<10; i++)
    if(x != y);
        printf("x = %d y = %d\n", x, y);

```

2.

```c
int k, num=30;
k = (num>5 ? (num <=10 ? 100 : 200): 500);
printf("%d\n", num);

```

3.

```c
struct emp {
    char name[20];
    float sal;
};
struct emp e[10];
int i;
for(i=0; i<=9; i++)
    scanf("%s %f", e[i].name, &e[i].sal);
// Identify the error in scanf usage

```

4.
**Theory:** The keyword used to transfer control from a function back to the calling function is?

5.

```c
long fun(int num){
    int i;
    long f=1;
    for(i=1; i<=num; i++)
        f = f * i;
    return f;
}
// What does this function calculate?

```

6.

```c
float a = 3.14;
char *j;
j = (char*)&a;
printf("%d\n", *j);

```

7.

```c
int a=10, *j;
void *k;
j = k = &a;
j++;
k++;
printf("%u %u\n", j, k);
// Will this compile in Turbo C?

```

8.
**Theory:** Which of the following statements are correct about an array?

1. The array `int num[26];` can store 26 elements.
2. The expression `num[1]` designates the very first element in the array.
3. It is necessary to initialize the array at the time of declaration.
4. The declaration `num[SIZE]` is allowed if SIZE is a macro.

**Theory:** The library function used to find the last occurrence of a character in a string is?

10.

```c
char ch = 'A';
printf("%d, %d, %d", sizeof(ch), sizeof('A'), sizeof(3.14f));
// Assuming char=1, int=4, float=4 bytes

```

## APTITUDE (10)

1. A motorboat, whose speed is 15 km/hr in still water, goes 30 km downstream and comes back in a total of 4 hours 30 minutes. What is the speed of the stream?
2. A man took a loan from a bank at the rate of 12% p.a. simple interest. After 3 years he had to pay ₹5400 interest only for the period. What was the principal amount borrowed?
3. A man walked diagonally across a square lot. Approximately, what was the percent saved by not walking along the edges?
4. By investing in 16% stock at 64, one earns ₹1500. What is the total investment made?
5. A man buys a watch for ₹1950 in cash and sells it for ₹2200 at a credit of 1 year. If the rate of interest is 10% per annum, does he gain or lose, and by how much?
6. **Find the odd man out:**
   10, 25, 45, 54, 60, 75, 80
7. **Find the wrong number in the sequence:**
   36, 54, 18, 27, 9, 18.5, 4.5
8. **Find the wrong number in the sequence:**
   582, 605, 588, 611, 634, 617, 600
9. **Find the wrong number in the sequence:**
   56, 72, 90, 110, 132, 150
10. **Insert the missing number:**
    8, 24, 12, 36, 18, 54, (...)

## C PROGRAMMING SNIPPETS (10)

1.
```c
char str[] = "Nagpur";
str[0] = 'K';
printf("%s, ", str);
str = "Kanpur"; // Note: Check validity of this line
printf("%s", str+1);

```

2.

```c
int i = 4, j = 8;
printf("%d, %d, %d\n", i|j&j|i, i|j&j|i, i^j);

```

3.
**Theory:** Bit fields CANNOT be used in a union. (True / False)

4.

```c
FILE *fp;
char ch;
int i = 1;
fp = fopen("myfile.c", "r");
while((ch=getc(fp))!=EOF) {
    if(ch == '\n')
        i++;
}
fclose(fp);
// What does this code count?

```

5.
**Theory:** The first argument to be supplied at the command-line must always be the count of total arguments. (True / False)

6.

```c
char c = 48;
int i, mask = 01;
for(i=1; i<=5; i++) {
    printf("%c", c|mask);
    mask = mask<<1;
}

```

7.

```c
typedef struct data; {
    int x;
    sdata *b;
} sdata;
// Identify the error

```

8.
**Theory:** Which header file should you include if you are going to develop a function that can accept a variable number of arguments?

9.

```c
#include <stdarg.h>
void varfun(int n, ...);
int main(){
    varfun(3, 7, -11.2, 0.66);
    return 0;
}
void varfun(int n, ...){
    float *ptr;
    int num;
    va_start(ptr, n);
    num = va_arg(ptr, int); // Identify the potential error here
    printf("%d", num);
}

```

10.
**Theory:** `va_list` is an array that holds information needed by `va_arg` and `va_end`. (True / False)
